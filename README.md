# FastAPI Project with Pytest and GitHub Actions

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the integration of FastAPI with Pytest for testing purposes, along with the implementation of GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI). It enforces branch protection rules to maintain code quality and integrity.

## Features

- **FastAPI Integration:** Utilizes FastAPI to build a RESTful API.
- **Pytest Implementation:** Illustrates testing strategies with Pytest for unit and API endpoint tests.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Configures a workflow for automated testing on each push or PR.
- **Branch Protection:** Sets the `main` branch as protected, allowing updates only via pull requests.
- **Test Enforcement:** Requires all tests to pass in the GitHub Actions workflow before merging PRs into the `main` branch.
